wavs\0.wav|One of those moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come.
wavs\1.wav|No, earlier this morning, I returned from Israel.
wavs\2.wav|They tell me I'm the first American president to travel there during a war.
wavs\3.wav|I met with the Prime Minister and members of his Cabinet.
wavs\4.wav|And most movingly, I met with Israelis who had personally lived through horrific horror of the attack by Hamas on the 7th of October.
wavs\5.wav|more than 1,300 people slaughtered in Israel.
wavs\6.wav|including at least 32 American citizens.
wavs\7.wav|Israelis, Americans taken hostage.
wavs\8.wav|as I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas.
wavs\9.wav|We're pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home.
wavs\10.wav|As president, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage.
wavs\11.wav|The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world.
wavs\12.wav|But sadly, the Jewish people know perhaps better than anyone.
wavs\13.wav|that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others.
wavs\14.wav|I saw people who were strong, determined, resilient, and also angry.
wavs\15.wav|and shock and in deep, deep pain.
wavs\16.wav|I also spoke with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority.
wavs\17.wav|and reiterate it, the United States remains committed to the Palestinian people.
wavs\18.wav|right to dignity and to self-determination.
wavs\19.wav|The actions of a Moss terrorist don't take that right away.
wavs\20.wav|Like so many other, I'm heartbroken.
wavs\21.wav|by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, including the explosion.
wavs\22.wav|We mourn every innocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have an opportunity.
wavs\23.wav|You know, the assault on Israel echoes nearly 20 months of war, tragedy and brutality inflicted on the people of Ukraine.
wavs\24.wav|that were very badly hurt since Putin launched his all-out invasion.
wavs\25.wav|We've not forgotten the mass graves, the bodies found bearing signs of torture.
wavs\26.wav|Rape used as a weapon by the Russians.
wavs\27.wav|and thousands and thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly taken into Russia, stolen from their parents.
wavs\28.wav|Amash and Putin represent different threats.
wavs\29.wav|They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy, completely annihilate it.
wavs\30.wav|Hamas' stated purpose for existing is the destruction of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people.
wavs\31.wav|Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people.
wavs\32.wav|Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields.
wavs\33.wav|and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of that.
wavs\34.wav|Meanwhile, Putin denies Ukraine has or ever had real statehood. He claims the Soviet Union created Ukraine.
wavs\35.wav|And just two weeks ago, he told the world that if the United States and our allies withdraw, and if the United States withdraw, our allies will as well.
wavs\36.wav|military support for Ukraine would have, quote, a week left to live, but we're not withdrawing.
wavs\37.wav|I know these conflicts can seem far away.
wavs\38.wav|It's natural to ask, why does this matter to America?
wavs\39.wav|So let me share with you why making sure Israel and Ukraine succeed is vital for America's national security.
wavs\40.wav|You know, history has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror.
wavs\41.wav|when dictators don't pay a price for their aggression.
wavs\42.wav|they cause more chaos and death and more destruction.
wavs\43.wav|and the cost and the threats to America and the world keep rising.
wavs\44.wav|So if we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control in Ukraine,
wavs\45.wav|he won't limit himself just to Ukraine. Putin's already threatened to remind, quote, remind Poland
wavs\46.wav|that their Western land was a gift from Russia.
wavs\47.wav|One of his top advisors, a former president of Russia, has called Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania Russia's Baltic provinces.
wavs\48.wav|These are all NATO allies. For 75 years, NATO has kept peace in Europe.
wavs\49.wav|and has been the cornerstone of American security.
wavs\50.wav|And if Putin attacks a NATO ally, we will defend every inch of NATO which a treaty requires and calls for.
wavs\51.wav|We'll have something that we do not seek. Make it clear, we do not seek. We do not seek to have American troops fighting in Russia or fighting against Russia.
wavs\52.wav|We know that our allies and maybe most importantly, our adversaries and competitors are watching.
wavs\53.wav|They're watching our response in Ukraine as well.
wavs\54.wav|And if we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence.
wavs\55.wav|would-be aggressors around the world be emboldened to try the same?
wavs\56.wav|The risk of conflict and chaos could spread in other parts of the world.
wavs\57.wav|in the Indo-Pacific, in the Middle East, especially in the Middle East.
wavs\58.wav|Iran is supporting Russia in Ukraine and it's supporting Hamas and other terrorist groups in the region.
wavs\59.wav|and will continue to hold them accountable, I might add.
wavs\60.wav|The United States and our partners across the region are working to build a better future for the Middle East.
wavs\61.wav|one where the Middle East is more stable.
wavs\62.wav|and through innovative projects like the Indian Middle East-Europe Rail Corridor that I announced this year at the Summit of the World's Biggest Economies.
wavs\63.wav|more predictable markets, more employment, less rage, less grievances, less war when connected.
wavs\64.wav|benefits the people who would benefit the people of the Middle East and would benefit us.
wavs\65.wav|American leadership is what holds the world together.
wavs\66.wav|American alliances will keep us, America, safe.
wavs\67.wav|American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with.
wavs\68.wav|Put all that at risk if we walk away from Ukraine.
wavs\69.wav|That's why tomorrow I'm going to send to Congress an urgent budget request.
wavs\70.wav|to fund America's national security needs, to support our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine.
wavs\71.wav|is a smart investment that's going to pay dividends for American security for generations.
wavs\72.wav|Help us keep American troops out of harm's way.
wavs\73.wav|Help us build a world that is safer, more peaceful, more prosperous for our children and grandchildren.
wavs\74.wav|We must make sure that they have what they need to protect their people today and always.
wavs\75.wav|a security package I'm sending to Congress and asking Congress to do.
wavs\76.wav|is an unprecedented commitment to Israel's security.
wavs\77.wav|Israel's qualitative military edge, which we've committed to.
wavs\78.wav|qualitative military edge.
wavs\79.wav|We're going to make sure Iron Dome continues to guard the skies over Israel.
wavs\80.wav|We're gonna make sure other hostile actors in the region.
wavs\81.wav|know that Israel is stronger than ever and prevent this conflict from spreading.
wavs\82.wav|President Netanyahu and I discussed again yesterday.
wavs\83.wav|The critical nature is to operate by the laws of war.
wavs\84.wav|That means protecting civilians in combat as best as they can. The people of Gaza urgently need food.
wavs\85.wav|yesterday in discussions with the leaders of Israel and Egypt.
wavs\86.wav|for the first shipment of humanitarian assistance from the United Nations to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
wavs\87.wav|Hamas does not divert or steal this shipment.
wavs\88.wav|these shipments, we're going to provide an opening for sustained delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians.
wavs\89.wav|As I said in Israel, as hard as it is, we cannot give up on peace. We cannot give up on a two-state solution.
wavs\90.wav|and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety.
wavs\91.wav|You know, and here at home, we have to be honest with ourselves.
wavs\92.wav|In recent years, too much hate has given too much oxygen, fueling racism, the rise of anti-Semitism, Islamic phobia, right here in America.
wavs\93.wav|It's also intensified in the wake of recent events that led to the horrific threats and attacks that both shock us and break our hearts.
wavs\94.wav|On October 7th, terror attacks have triggered deep scars and terrible memories in the Jewish community.
wavs\95.wav|Today, Jewish families worried about being targeted in school.
wavs\96.wav|wearing symbols of their face walking down the street.
wavs\97.wav|or going out about their daily lives.
wavs\98.wav|And I know many of you in the Muslim American community, the Arab American community,
wavs\99.wav|The Palestinian-American community and so many others are outraged.
wavs\100.wav|hearty, saying to yourself, here we go again.
wavs\101.wav|with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9-11.
wavs\102.wav|A little boy, here in the United States, a little boy who just turned six years old was murdered.
wavs\103.wav|proud Palestinian American family.
wavs\104.wav|I can't stand by and stand silent when this happens.
wavs\105.wav|We must, without equivocation, denounce anti-Semitism. We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia.
wavs\106.wav|to all you hurting, those of you hurting. I want you to know I see you. You belong.
wavs\107.wav|I want to say this to you. You're all America. You're all America.
wavs\108.wav|This is in a moment, you know, in moments like these, when fear and suspicion, anger and rage run hard.
wavs\109.wav|We have to work harder than ever to hold on to the values that make us who we are.
wavs\110.wav|We're a nation of religious freedom, freedom of expression.
wavs\111.wav|We all have a right to debate and disagree without fear of being targeted in schools or workplaces or in our communities.
wavs\112.wav|I must renounce violence and vitriol. See each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans.
wavs\113.wav|I said that when America experienced the hell of 9-11, we felt enraged as well. While we sought and got justice, we made mistakes.
wavs\114.wav|So I caution the government of Israel not to be blinded by rage.
wavs\115.wav|And here in America, let us not forget who we are. We reject all forms.
wavs\116.wav|whether against Muslim, Jews, or anyone.
wavs\117.wav|to make sure we can continue to send Ukraine the weapons they need to defend themselves and their country without interruption.
wavs\118.wav|so Ukraine can stop Putin's brutality in Ukraine.
wavs\119.wav|When Putin invaded Ukraine, he thought he would take Kiev.
wavs\120.wav|Well, over a year later, Putin has failed, and he continues to fail.
wavs\121.wav|Kiev still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian people.
wavs\122.wav|Ukraine has regained more than 50% of the territory Russian troops once occupied.
wavs\123.wav|backed by a U.S.-led coalition of more than 50 countries around the world.
wavs\124.wav|all doing his part to support Keeve.
wavs\125.wav|Putin has turned to Iran and North Korea.
